TODO

short term

 * change 16bit access handlers to use ldrh/strh since unaligned accesses seem to work on the 3DS
 * color math, windows, etc (blending would be the most important, so we don't get opaque layers making games unplayable)
 
long term

 * sound
 * scaling/borders (render to a texture and use the PICA200 instead of rendering to framebuffer)
 * expansion chips and other fancy shiz
 * 3D
