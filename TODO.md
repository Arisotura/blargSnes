TODO

short term

 * change 16bit access handlers to use ldrh/strh since unaligned accesses seem to work on the 3DS
   (done on main CPU side, has yet to be done for SPC700)
 * windows, those can be important
 
long term

 * sound
 * screen scaling
 * expansion chips and other fancy shiz
 * 3D
 * mosaic? this effect is only used for screen transitions
