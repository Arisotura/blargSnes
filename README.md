A SNES emulator for the 3DS. If you have seen lolSnes, you know what to expect.

 * PPU: ~50% (modes 0-4 and 7, sprites)
 * SPC700: 99% (mostly everything is in)
 * DSP: no point yet
 * DMA and HDMA
 * SRAM with auto-saving

Missing, oncoming features
 * backgrounds with 16x16 tiles
 * PPU color math (blending)
 * DSP, whenever we get to play sound on the 3DS
