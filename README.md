A SNES emulator for the 3DS. If you have seen lolSnes, you know what to expect.


Features
 * CPU: 100% (only lacking a few unimportant tidbits)
 * PPU: ~80% (modes 0-4 and 7, 8x8 and 16x16 tiles, sprites, color math, brightness, windows)
 * SPC700: 99% (mostly everything is in)
 * DSP: lacking noise and echo; interpolation is linear only
 * DMA and HDMA
 * SRAM with auto-saving

Missing, oncoming features
 * expansion chips
 * hires (modes 5/6), mosaic, other fancy shiz
